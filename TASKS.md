## read this first:
The main purpose of this repo is to setup a code base for you guys to add additional features / fix bugs.
Currently it is definitely not UI/design perfect. Our goal is to test your react/redux/node/test skills.
CSS skills is essential, but you don't have to make the app pixel perfect because it will cost lots of time.

#### What we value the most is:
- The ability (at least trying hard) to write clean code which is easy to read and test
- Write scalable code, in simple ways, it means adding additional features will require less restructure and effort.
- Do not leave tech debt unless you need to quickly patch a serious production bug (definitely not for our case)
- Refactor at an early stage whenever neccessary
- The ability to struture your code in a logical way
- You know about your code performance
- Think throughly for any potential new libraries. A bad example will be to import a huge package and only because you need to use one simple method.
- Tests. We know TDD is hard to follow, but make sure you have your tests written for any files **with logics** in it.

#### About the tasks:
How many tasks you've accomplished is NOT what we care about the most. Please do not rush.

If you are stuck, set up a timeframe to allow yourself to resolve it first, if you can't work it out, please ask me.
This is very normal, so you don't have feel pressured to solve everything yourself.

If you have any questions or better proposals to the existing setup, you are more than welcome to talk to me.

There is no right or wrong about the approach you decided to take for certain tasks.
As long as they make sense, i.e. you know exactly why you wrote this line, this method, why in this file, why you needed to use this library etc.
But keep in mind that your code should try to be clean, dry, scalable, readable, and importantly testable.
